        <div class="matchup">
            <img src="[AWAY_TEAM_ICON_FILE_PATH]" alt="[AWAY_ABB]" class="team-icon">
            <span class="team-name">[Away Team Full Name]</span>
            <span class="score">[Away Score]</span>
            <span class="at">@</span>
            <span class="score">[Home Score]</span>
            <span class="team-name">[Home Team Full Name]</span>
            <img src="[HOME_TEAM_ICON_FILE_PATH]" alt="[HOME_ABB]" class="team-icon">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="summary">
        [Summary content here]
    </div>
</div>
```

You will receive team_icons data with each team's icon_file_path. Use the team abbreviation to look up the icon.
Common abbreviations: NYJ (Jets), CIN (Bengals), BUF (Bills), MIA (Dolphins), NE (Patriots), etc.
Extract team names from the recap content and map them to abbreviations, then use team_icons[abbreviation].icon_file_path
